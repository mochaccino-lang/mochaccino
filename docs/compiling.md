# Compiling A Program
---
To compile a program, first follow the installation instructions, then make sure you're in the directory with the uncompiled file, then do: <br>
`bpc YOURFILENAME` <br>
Then follow on-screen instructions. <br>
Make sure when compiling, you don't put the file prefix. (it's assumed that it's `.mochaccino`)
